utils => utilities that will use all across the app

Two Types of export :-

1. default export - one file can have 1 default export

export default componentName;

import componentName from "Path";

2. named export - one file can have multiple named exports 
   To import named export use {name}

export const componentName;

import {componentName} from "Path";

We can use Named export and Default export together. So you should export like:

export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;
and import like:

import MyComponent, {MyComponent2} from "./MyComponent";

What are React Hooks?
Normal JS Utility Functions

In React version 16.8, React introduced a new pattern called Hooks. React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.

React provides a bunch of standard in-built hooks:
useState: (SuperPowerful State Variables ) To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.
          Whenever state variable gets updated, react rerenders the component
useEffect: To manage side-effects like API calls, subscriptions, timers, mutations, and more.
useContext: To return the current value for a context.
useReducer: A useState alternative to help with complex state management.
useCallback: It returns a memorized version of a callback to help a child component not re-render unnecessarily.
useMemo: It returns a memoized value that helps in performance optimizations.
useRef: It returns a ref object with a current property. The ref object is mutable. It is mainly used to access a child component imperatively.
useLayoutEffect: It fires at the end of all DOM mutations. It's best to use useEffect as much as possible over this one as the useLayoutEffect fires synchronously.
useDebugValue: Helps to display a label in React DevTools for custom hooks.
