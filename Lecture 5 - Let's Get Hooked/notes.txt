utils => utilities that will use all across the app

Two Types of export :-

1. default export - one file can have 1 default export

export default componentName;

import componentName from "Path";

2. named export - one file can have multiple named exports 
   To import named export use {name}

export const componentName;

import {componentName} from "Path";

We can use Named export and Default export together. So you should export like:

export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;
and import like:

import MyComponent, {MyComponent2} from "./MyComponent";
