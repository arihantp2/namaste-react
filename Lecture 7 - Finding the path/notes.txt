if no dependency array in useEffect => useEffect is called on every render
if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on initial render (just once)
if we have something in dependency like [btnState] => useEffect is called on dependency changes/updated.

UseState hook need to call inside component.
for best practices,write it on top side of the component
