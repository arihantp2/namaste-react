Seperation of concerns and also called single responsibility principal

api calls approaches

page loads --> api 500ms --> Render

page loads --> Render ==> Api ==> re render (better effect better ux)

useEffect(()=> {},[])
useeffect first argument is arroe function is a call bck function and 2nd srgument is the dependency array.

after component renders callback function get's called.
